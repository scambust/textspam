# textspam
small program to spam scammers as a way to annoy them

to use: run the program and send your first message to the scammer as normal
press the 'esc' key to repeat that message 10,000 times

If you want to change the amount of times the message is sent:
          change this value to the # of messages you want to send
                  ^
while count <= 10000:
If you want to change the speed at which the message is replayed(replay speed is dependent on your typing speed):
                                  change this value 
                                      ^
keyboard.play(recorded, speed_factor=100)

*the program will display number of times the loop is itterated within the console so you can keep track of it. Try your best not to click anywhere after you set the program in motion as it can mess up the code or any written prodjects you may have
